			 Freyja Command List

Unless otherwise specified, any argument is ignored and the command
does not prompt.

Regular Commands:


^@	Place the mark at the point.

^A	Move to the beginning of the current line.

^B	Move backward one character.  With an argument, move backward
	that many characters.

^C	If the point is within a word, rotate the case of the rest of
	the word among lower -> Capital -> UPPER -> lower.  If the
	point is between words, rotate the case of the previous word.

^D	Delete the following character.  With an argument, deletes that
	many characters.  Deleted text is not saved in the kill buffer.

^E	Move to the end of the current line.

^F	Move forward one character.  With an argument, move forward
	that many characters.

^G	Abort.

^H, BS, Back Arrow	Delete the preceding character.  With an
	argument, deletes that many characters.  Deleted text is not
	saved in the kill buffer.

^I, Tab	Insert a Tab.  With an argument, inserts that many Tab characters.

^J, LF, Line Feed 	Split the line at the point.  Indent the text
	after the point (on the new line) the same amount as the text
	on the original line was indented.  With an argument, repeats
	the split that many times.  (This will leave blank lines
	containing only indentation in the middle.)

^K	Delete the text to the end of the current line or, if at the
	end of the line, delete the line break.  With an argument,
	repeats its actions that many times.  Thus, if the point was
	at the beginning of a line, the sequence ^U ^K will delete two
	lines.  Save the deleted text in the kill buffer.

^L	Center the point at the preferred percentage on the screen.
	The PREFPCT value in the resource file controls the preferred
	percentage.

^M, CR, Return	Insert a line break, leaving the point after the break.
	With an argument, inserts that many line breaks.

^N	Move down to the next line, staying in as nearly the same
	column as possible.  With an argument, moves down that many
	lines.  Successive ^N and ^P commands attempt to preserve
	the original column.

^O	Open line: insert a line break, leaving the point before the
	break.	With an argument, opens that many lines.

^P	Move up to the preceding line, staying in as nearly the same
	column as possible.  With an argument, moves up that many
	lines.  Successive ^N and ^P commands attempt to preserve
	the original column.

^Q	Quote: Ask for a character and insert that character into the
	buffer, ignoring any special meaning.   With an argument,
	inserts the character that many times.

^R	Reverse search: ask for a search string and search backwards
	for the previous occurrance of it.  The point is left at the start
	of the string ("after" the string when considered in terms of the
	direction of the search).  Lowercase letters in the search
	string match uppercase letters in the text.  With an argument,
	searches for the Nth occurance of the string.

^S	Forward search: ask for a search string and search forwards
	for the next occurrance of it.  The point is left at the end
	of the string.  Lowercase letters in the search string match
	uppercase letters in the text.  With an argument, searches for
	the Nth occurance of the string.

^T	Twiddle: interchange the two characters before the point. The
	type of interchange can be affected with the TWIDDRAG value in
	the resource file.

^U	Universal argument. There are two forms:

	^U ^U .... <cmd>	does <cmd> 4, 16, 64, 256, ... times
				depending upon the number of ^Us (each
				^U is a multiplier by 4)

	^U <integer> <cmd>	does <cmd> <integer> times

^V	View next: move down to the next screen.  The command operates
	in terms of screens, not lines, so a ^V ^Z will not necessarily
	leave the point at its starting position.  The amount of overlap
	between the screens is specified by the VOVERLAP value in
	the resource file.  With an argument, move by multiple screens.
	The type of motion can be altered with the SCRNMOVE value in
	the resource file.

^W	Delete the text between the point and the mark ("cut"); copy
	the deleted text to the kill buffer.  With an argument, the
	deleted text is NOT copied to the kill buffer.

^X	Prefix for the ^X commands listed below.

^Y	Yank: copy the contents of the kill buffer to the point.  The
	mark is left at the start of the yanked text and the point at
	the end ("paste").

^Z	Move up to the previous screen.  The command operates in terms
	of screens, not lines, so a ^Z ^V will not necessarily leave
	the point at its starting position.  The amount of overlap
	between the screens is specified by the VOVERLAP value in
	the resource file.  With an argument, move by multiple screens.
	The type of motion can be altered with the SCRNMOVE value in
	the resource file.

^[, Esc	Prefix for the Meta commands listed below.

^\	Delete all white space (indentation) on the current line.

^]	Execute the keyboard macro.  With an argument, repeats the
	execution that many times.

^^	Bring up the main menus.

^_	no command

SP ... ~	Insert themselves.  With an argument, the character
	is inserted that many times.

^?, Del	UNIX: Delete the preceding character.  With an argument, deletes
	that many characters.  Deleted text is not saved in the kill buffer.

	MSDOS:	Delete the preceding word.  With an argument, delete
	that many words. Deleted text is saved in the kill buffer.


Control-X (^X) Commands:


^X ^B	Create a system buffer and place in it a list of all buffers
	and associated information.  With an argument, system buffers
	are also included in the list.  The SKIPSYS value in the
	resource file also controls whether system buffers are left
	out ("skipped") from the list.

^X ^C	Exit / quit the editor.  With an argument, always saves all
	modified non-system buffers without asking.

^X ^D	DIRED: Ask for a directory or file name or starname, and insert
	a list of all files that match that name into a system buffer.
	An empty directory or file name means to list all files in the
	current directory.  With an argument, a "long" list is created
	that includes file size, date, and other information.  On
	MSDOS systems, you can't just give a directory name, it must
	include a file name part (e.g., type "/dos/" to see all files
	in the /dos directory).

^X ^E	Ask for and execute a system command.  May not work reliably
	on the system manager versions.

^X ^F	Ask for the name of a file.  If the file name matches one that
	has already been read it, go to that buffer.  Otherwise, read
	that file into a new buffer whose name is derived from the file
	name.  If the new filename does not contain a directory part,
	the match ignores the directory part.  You can get around this
	matching by reading in a file named "./<desired name>".  On
	MSDOS systems, with an argument, no ^M ^J to newline
	processing is performed.

	The command's behavior changes if you are in the DIRED buffer.
	In this case, it does not prompt you for the filename, but
	instead uses the filename found on the current line.  The filename
	is the last "thing" on the current line, where "things" are
	marked off by Space and Tab characters.

^X ^G	Abort: cancel ^X prefix.

^X ^H	Delete from the point to the beginning of the current sentence.
	Deleted text is saved in the kill buffer.

^X ^I	Ask for the name of a file and inserts the contents of the file
	at the point.  On MSDOS systems, with an argument, no ^M ^J to
	newline processing is performed.

^X ^K	Ask for the name of a file and delete the specified file.

	The command's behavior changes if you are in the DIRED buffer.
	In this case, it does not prompt you for the filename, but
	instead uses the filename found on the current line.  The filename
	is the last "thing" on the current line, where "things" are
	marked off by Space and Tab characters.  Note that it does
	_not_ update the DIRED display.

^X ^L	Convert all text in the region to lower case.

^X ^P	Print the region.  If an argument is supplied, the file is sent
	"raw:" no pagination or newline conversions are performed.

^X ^R	Ask for the name of a file and read the contents of the file into
	the buffer: used for refreshing the buffer from the copy on disk.
	On MSDOS systems, with an argument, no ^M ^J to newline processing
	is performed.

^X ^S	Save the contents of the current buffer to the associated file.
	The SAVEUNMOD value in the resource file controls whether saves
	are performed if the buffer's modification flag is not set.
	The BACKUP value in the resource file controls whether backup
	copies are made.  On MSDOS systems, with an argument, no
	newline to ^M ^J processing is performed.

^X ^U	Convert all text in the region to upper case.

^X ^V	View next other window: move the text in the other window down
	to the next screen.  The command operates in terms of screens,
	not lines, so a ^X ^V ^X ^Z will not necessarily leave the text
	in the other window at its starting position.  The amount of
	overlap between the screens is specified by the VOVERLAP value in
	the resource file.  With an argument, move by multiple screens.
	The type of motion can be altered with the SCRNMOVE value in
	the resource file.

^X ^W	Ask for the name of a file and write the contents of the
	buffer to that file.  On MSDOS systems, with an argument, no
	newline to ^M ^J processing is performed.  The BACKUP value in
	the resource file controls whether backup copies are made.

^X ^X	Exchange the point and mark.

^X ^Z	View previous other window: move the text in the other window up
	to the preceeding screen.  The command operates in terms of screens,
	not lines, so a ^X ^Z ^X ^V will not necessarily leave the text
	in the other window at its starting position.  The amount of
	overlap between the screens is specified by the VOVERLAP value in
	the resource file.  With an argument, move by multiple screens.
	The type of motion can be altered with the SCRNMOVE value in
	the resource file.

^X ^\	Remove all trailing Space and Tab characters from all lines
	in the region.

^X #	Display the margin settings.  With an argument, inserts a ruler
	line containing the current settings at the start of the buffer.

^X (	Start collecting a keyboard macro.

^X )	End collecting a keyboard macro.  If an argument is supplied,
	it assumes that it was invoked from the menus (and not ^X ) ).

^X +	Cycle the screen type to the next value.  The list of values is
	found in the TYPELIST value in the resource file.  If the current
	screen type is not in the list, the first entry on the list is
	used.   If an argument is supplied, ask if you are sure and if so,
	set the screen type to that value.  See the SCRNTYPE value in
	the resource file for a list of values.

^X ,	With an argument, set this buffer's tab spacing to that argument.
	With no argument, display an error message.  The TABW value in
	the resource file controls the default tab spacing.  The tab
	spacing of a buffer is inherited from that in the (old)
	current buffer when the buffer is created.  The tab spacing
	can also be set from a ruler line.

^X -	Toggle the setting of the SWAPPGNL value, which toggles the
	meanings of the Up/Down Arrow and PgUp/Dn keys.  The argument
	is ignored.

^X .	With an argument, set this buffer's left margin (indent
	column) to that argument. With no argument, display an error
	message.  The LMAR value in the resource file controls the
	default left margin.  The left margin of a buffer is inherited from
	that in the (old) current buffer when the buffer is created.  The
	left margin can also be set from a ruler line.

^X /	Brings up a menu that asks for a fill mode for this buffer.  With
	an argument, sets the fill mode as:

		0	None
		1	Fill
		2	Wrap

	The FILL value in the resource file controls the default fill
	mode.  The fill mode of a buffer is inherited from that in the
	(old) current buffer when the buffer is created.  The fill
	mode IS NOT set from a ruler line.

^X 1	One window mode.

^X 2	Two window mode.  Split the screen horizontally.

^X 3	Two window mode, leave the point in the other window.

^X 7	Clear the meta bit (bit 2^7) in all characters in the region. 
	With an argument, sets the meta bit.

^X 8	Treat the argument as the decimal value of a (presumably 8-bit)
	character and insert it.

^X 9	Treat the argument as a scan code and execute the function key
	specified by that code.

^X <	Scroll the window left.  With an argument, sets the left margin
	to the specified column.  The HOVERLAP value in the resource file
	controls the amount of overlap.

^X =	Display the current cursor position.

^X >	Scroll the window right.  With an argument, sets the left margin
	to the specified column.  The HOVERLAP value in the resource file
	controls the amount of overlap.

^X @	Show the decimal, hexadecimal, and octal representations
	of the character at the point.

^X B	Switch to the next buffer in the ring.  With an argument,
	system buffers may be switched to.  The SKIPSYS value in the
	resource file also controls whether system buffers are skipped.

^X C	Exit / quit the editor.  With an argument, always saves all
	modified non-system buffers without asking.

^X D	If the DIRED buffer already exists, switch to that buffer.
	Otherwise, this is the same as the ^X ^D command.

^X E	Execute the keyboard macro.  With an argument, repeats the
	execution that many times.

^X F	With an argument, set this buffer's right margin to that argument.
	With no argument, display an error message.  The RMAR value in
	the resource file controls the default right margin.  The
	right margin of a buffer is inherited from that in the (old)
	current buffer when the buffer is created.  The right margin
	can also be set from a ruler line.

^X H	Bring up the Help menu.

^X K	Kill (delete) the current buffer and move to the previous
	buffer in the ring.  With an argument, do not skip system buffers
	when moving to the previous buffer.  The SKIPSYS value in the
	resource file also controls whether system buffers are skipped.
	If no non-system buffers are left, the scratch buffer is
	automatically (re)created.

^X O	Switch to the other window.

^X P	Print the buffer.  With an argument, the data is sent "raw:"
	no pagination or newline conversions are performed.  The
	point is left at the beginning of the buffer and the mark at the
	end.

^X Q	Quote: Ask for a character and insert that character into the
	buffer, ignoring any special meaning.   With an argument,
	inserts the character that many times.

	With an argument, indent by that many characters.

^X ^	Grow the current window by the number of lines specified by the
	argument.

^X `	Toggle whether gray space is visible.  The VISGRAY value in
	the resource file controls whether grayspace is initially
	visible.

^X {	Convert all text in the region from fill- to wrap-style newlines.
	Fill-style newlines use ^J to indicate a line break and two ^Js
	to indicate a paragraph break.  Wrap-style newlines use soft newline
	(^_) internally to indicate a new line and ^J to indicate a
	paragraph break.

^X }	Convert all text in the region from wrap- to fill-style newlines.
	Wrap-style newlines use soft newline (^_) internally to
	indicate a new line and ^J to indicate a paragraph break.
	Fill-style newlines use ^J to indicate a line break and two ^Js
	to indicate a paragraph break.

^X ^?	Delete from the point to the beginning of the current line.

	it.

Esc ^]	With no argument, insert the contents of the keyboard macro
	into the current buffer at the point.  Note that function keys
	are NOT preserved.

	With an argument of 4, load as much of the current buffer as
	will fit into the keyboard macro.  Again, there is no way of
	loading function keys with this method.

	With any other argument, the specified keyboard macro is
	fetched from the resource file and loaded.  Function keys
	may be loaded by this mechanism.

Esc SP	Place the mark at the point.

Esc 0-9	Executes the specified keyboard macro directly from the
	resource file (i.e., without altering the macro saved with ^X
	( and X _) ).  Any argument is passed to the macro, just as
	with ^].  Do not include these commands in menu key sequences
	(they use the same internal buffer as menu key sequences).

	move backward that many sentences.

Esc B	Move backward one word.  With an argument, move backward that
	many words.

Esc C	Capitalize the following word.  With an argument, capitalize
	that many words.  The WORDEND value in the resource file
	controls where the point is left.

Esc D	Delete the following word.  With an argument, delete that many
	words. Deleted text is saved in the kill buffer.  The WORDEND
	value in the resource file controls how much text is deleted.

Esc E	Move to the end of the current sentence.  With an argument,
	move by that many sentences.

Esc F	Move forward one word.  With an argument, move forward that
	many words.  The WORDEND value in the resource file controls
	where the point is left.

Esc G	Fill all paragraphs in the region. Fill- or wrap-style
	newlines are used depending upon the buffer mode.  Fill-style
	is used if filling is turned off. The left margin is not used.
	With an argument, sets the region to include the whole buffer
	and fills the whole buffer.

Esc H	Place the point and the mark around the current paragraph.
	With an argument, place the point at the beginning and the
	mark at the end of the buffer.

Esc K	Delete the remainder of the current sentence.  With an argument,
	deletes that many more sentences. Deleted text is saved in the
	kill buffer.

Esc L	Convert the following word to lower case.  With an argument,
	convert that many words.  The WORDEND value in the resource
	file controls where the point is left.

	occurance of the old string, replace it with the new.

Esc S	Center the current line between the left and right margins.

Esc T	Transpose the adjoining words.

Esc U	Convert the following word to upper case.  With an argument,
	convert that many words.  The WORDEND value in the resource
	file controls where the point is left.

Esc V	Move up to the previous screen.  The command operates in terms
	of screens, not lines, so a Esc V ^V will not necessarily leave
	the point at its starting position.  The amount of overlap
	between the screens is specified by the VOVERLAP value in
	the resource file.  With an argument, move by multiple screens.
	The type of motion can be altered with the SCRNMOVE value in
	the resource file.

Esc W	Copy the region to the kill buffer.

Named Keys:


BS	Same as ^H, also BACK SPACE.
TAB	Same as ^I.
LF	Same as ^J, also LINE FEED (sometimes ENTER).
CR	Same as ^M, also CARRIAGE RETURN or RETURN (sometimes ENTER).

Special Function Key Commands:

The commands with key labels are invoked by pressing the named key
(easy enough, at least on an IBM PC or compatible).  The other
functions don't have key assignments: they are for use with menu
entries.  If you wanted to invoke one directly from the keyboard, use
the ^X 9 command.

code	label		what

^0			INTERNAL: Invoke the menu system.  Arguments:
				0	main menu
				1	help menu
				other	specified menu #

^1			INTERNAL: Do the ^: function.  Reads from the
			keyboard until a ` character is encountered.
			Then displays that string as a prompt.  Accept
			a response.  If valid, convert it to a number
			and turn that into the argument for use by the
			next command.  Otherwise, cancel the current
			macro.

^2			INTERNAL: Same as ^X ^F (including argument), but
			follow the search path to find the file.

^3	Ctrl-2		Place the mark at the point.

^4			Apropos.  Ask for a string and create a system
			buffer that conntains the help text for all
			commands that include that string in their help
			text.

^5			Create a system buffer whose contents describe
			the bindings of all keys.  The text is
			constructed from the command tables.  The text
			does not list self-insert or bad commands.

^6			Ask for a key and describe what the key does.

^7			Ask for the name of a file and save the region into
			that file, replacing any existing contents of
			that file.  On MSDOS systems, with an argument,
			no ^M ^J to newline conversion is performed.

^8			Show "About Freyja" information.  This information
			includes:

				version
				which code the resource file was made for
				current keyboard mode
				current screen type
				BIOS call override setting
				screen size (rows x columns)
				number of swap area pages in use, total,
					and page size
				current working directory

^9			Bring up the Printer Selection menu.

^10			MS/DOS only: Show a character attribute test
			screen.  Attribute values increase left to
			right, then top to bottom.

			specified by the VOVERLAP value in the
			resource file.  With an argument, move by
			multiple screens. The type of motion can be

			contain a directory part, the match ignores
			the directory part.  You can get around this
			by reading in a file named "./<desired name>".
			On MSDOS systems, with an argument, no ^M ^J
			to newline processing is performed.

^92	Shift-F9	Create a calendar for the current month in the
