			the yanked text and the point at the end ("paste").

OtherEnd	O	Exchange the point and mark.


----- File ------------------------------

		hot
entry		key	does

About		B	Show "About Freyja" information.  This information
			includes:

				version
				which code the resource file was made for
				current keyboard mode
				current screen type
				BIOS call override setting
				screen size (rows x columns)
				number of swap area pages in use, total,
					and page size
				current working directory

Open...|^X^F	O	Ask for the name of a file.  If the file name
			matches one that has already been read it, go
			to that buffer.  Otherwise, read that file
			into a new buffer whose name is derived from
			the file name.  If the new filename does not
			contain a directory part, the match ignores
			the directory part.  You can get around this
			matching by reading in a file named
			"./<desired name>".

			The command's behavior changes if you are in
			the DIRED buffer.  In this case, it does not
			prompt you for the filename, but instead uses
			the filename found on the current line.  The
			filename is the last "thing" on the current
			line, where "things" are marked off by Space
			and Tab characters.

New		N	Automatically opens the file "untitled".

Save|^X^S	S	Save the contents of the current buffer to the
			associated file. The SAVEUNMOD value in the
			resource file controls whether saves are
			performed if the buffer's modification flag is
			not set. The BACKUP value in the resource file
			controls whether backup copies are made.

SaveAs...	A	Ask for the name of a file and write the
			contents of the buffer to that file. The
			BACKUP value in the resource file controls
			whether backup copies are made.

SaveRegion...	G	Ask for the name of a file and save the region into
			that file, replacing any existing contents of
			that file.

SaveAll		V	Save the contents all non-system buffer(s) to
			the associated file(s). The SAVEUNMOD value in
			the resource file controls whether saves are
			performed if the buffer's modification flag is
			not set.  The BACKUP value in the resource
			file controls whether backup copies are made.
			On MSDOS systems, with an argument, no newline
			to ^M ^J processing is performed.

ReRead...	R	Ask for the name of a file and read the
			contents of the file into the buffer: used for
			refreshing the buffer from the copy on disk.

Insert...	I	Ask for the name of a file and inserts the
			contents of the file at the point.

Directory...	D	DIRED: Ask for a directory or file name or
			starname, and insert a list of all files that
			match that name into a system buffer. An empty
			directory or file name means to list all files
			in the current directory.  On MSDOS systems,
			you can't just give a directory name, it must
			include a file name part (e.g., type "/dos/"
			to see all files in the /dos directory).

ToDIRED		T	If the DIRED buffer already exists, switch to
			that buffer. Otherwise, this is the same as
			the Directory... item.

Delete...	L	Ask for the name of a file and delete the
			specified file.

			The command's behavior changes if you are in
			the DIRED buffer.  In this case, it does not
			prompt you for the filename, but instead uses
			the filename found on the current line.  The
			filename is the last "thing" on the current
			line, where "things" are marked off by Space
			and Tab characters.  Note that it does _not_
			update the DIRED display.

ClearModified	C	Clear the buffer modified flag.

Exit		X	Exit / quit the editor.

			list of values is found in the TYPELIST value
			in the resource file.  If the current screen
			type is not in the list, the first entry on
			the list is used.  See the SCRNTYPE value in
			the resource file for a list of values.
