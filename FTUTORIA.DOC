			   Freyja Tutorial

This document will help you get started in learning how to use
Freyja.  The best way to use it is to read it using Freyja.  You can
do this by giving the command:

	freyja ftutoria.doc

You can also bring this document up by starting Freyja and typing:

	^X ^F ftutoria.doc ^M (or Enter)

Most Freyja commands are given using the Control key.  This key is
sometimes labelled Ctrl or Ctl.  This type of command will be written
like this:

	^#

where "#" is replaced by the letter that is typed along with control
key.  For example, ^V for Control and the "V" key.  Now type the ^V
command.



Good.  You are on the next screen.  The ^V command causes Freyja to
move to the next screen of text.  Note that there is a little overlap
between the screens.  From now on, just type this command whenever
you finish reading a screen of text.

The natural next step is to learn how to move backwards by a screen. 
There are two ways for you to indicate this action to Freyja.  The
first is to give the ^Z command.  Try it, then use ^V to come back.

The ^Z command is specific to Freyja: other Emacs-type text editors
do not use that command for this purpose.  Rather, the Emacs
"standard" command for going back a screen is the ^[ V command.

This command looks a little funny.  The ^[ means the Control and [
keys.  While you can type it this way, this command is also available
on most keyboards as the Escape key (sometimes labelled Esc), and we
will use "Esc" to mean ^[.  Thus, you give the Esc V command by
pressing AND RELEASING the Escape key, then pressing the V key (it
doesn't matter whether you type an upper- or lower-case V).  Try it
and come back here.  The commands that start with the Escape key (or
are "prefixed" with the Escape key) are called "meta" commands.

On MS/DOS computers, Freyja treats Alt-shifted characters the same as
their corresponding meta commands.  On these computers, Freyja also
supports the arrow and function keys.  This means that you can press
Down Arrow to go down a line or PgDn to go down a screen.  See the
Freyja command list for details.

RECAP:

	^V	moves forward one screen
	^Z	moves backward one screen
	Esc V	moves backward one screen
	^L	recenter the screen
	Esc ^L	completely rebuild the screen display from scratch


Now that you can move by screens, how do you move in smaller amounts?

			 ^P (*P*revious line)
				|
				|
^B (*B*ackward character) -----   ----- ^F (*F*orward character)
				|
				|
			   ^N (*N*ext line)

Freyja commands are more-or-less mnemonic: the letter associated with
the command indicates what it does.  Thus, we have B for backward and
F for forward.  Try these commands for a while.

You will notice when moving around that you can't move to anyplace
that doesn't have text (for example, the blank lines between these
paragraphs).  When going forward, you move from the end of a line to
the start of the next line and vice-versa for moving backward.  When
moving to the next or previous lines, the cursor "jumps" to the left
edge of the screen then jumps back as you continue moving.

Note that if you should move off of the top or bottom of the screen,
the display is shifted automatically to keep your current position
visible.

You can move to the beginning or end of the line in one step by
giving the ^A (beginning of line (well, B was taken)) and ^E (end of
line) commands.  Note that if you keep giving the same commands, you
don't keep moving.  Is this right?

RECAP:

	^F	move forward by character
	^B	move backward by character
	^N	move to the next line
	^P	move to the previous line
	^A	move to the start of the line
	^E	move to the end of the line

The next step up from characters is words.  You will notice a pattern
right off:

		       Esc A (start of sentence)
				|
				|
   Esc B (*B*ackward word) -----   ----- Esc F (*F*orward word)
				|
				|
		       Esc E (*E*nd of sentence)

Try these.  Note that when moving by words, you are always left at the
"far end" of the word.  (You can change this behavior if you like.
See the RESOURCE FILE section in "freyja.doc".)  When moving by
sentences, successive Esc A and Esc E commands move to successive
sentence.  This is a little different than the ^A and ^E commands.

We will finish off the moving-around commands with two other
important ones:

	Esc <	move to the beginning of the file
	Esc >	move to the end of the file

(The Home and End keys do these, too.)  Try all of the commands that
you have learned so far (but try not to read ahead too much!).  Then
come back here and keep going.


MAKING CHANGES

If you want to add text to what is already there, it couldn't be
easier.  Just:

	- move the cursor so that the *left edge* is at the place that
	you want to add the text, and

	- type the new text (no Control-shifting or Escape-prefixing)

If you type a lot of text, you may notice that the end of the line
"spills" off the right edge of the screen.  The text is still there,
it just isn't visible.  If you want to see the text, just move there:

	- position the cursor to the line of interest
	- give the ^E command (not yet...!)
	- when done, give the ^A command to come back

Here is a long line to try it out on.  Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.

(You can also give the ^X > and ^X < commands to move the screen
right and left.  But that is telling.)

You don't need to keep typing a return at the end of each line.  You
can "fill" a paragraph in one swoop so that all the lines are a
reasonable length with the Esc Q command.  You can also turn on "word
wrap" with the ^X / comnmand.

So adding text is easy, how about deleting text?

You can delete text in many ways.  As many of these involve the ^H
command, it is worth pointing out that this is also found as a "Back
Space" or "BS" key (sometimes "Back Arrow") on many computers.  If
your computer has a "Del" or "Delete" key, this also works (although
it is a different character and written as ^?).

(This ^? character is typed on MS/DOS computers by Ctrl + Back Arrow.
On these computers, the Ctrl + Back Arrow command is supposed to
delete the entire previous word and Freyja does this.)

The basic deletion command are:

	^H	delete back one character (analagous to ^B)
	^D	delete forward one character (analagous to ^F)

	Esc ^H	delete back one word (analagous to Esc B)
	Esc D	delete forward one word (analagous to Esc F)

You can also delete by lines or sentences:

	^K	delete to the end of the line; if at the end of the
		line, delete just the line separator
	Esc K	delete forward one sentence (analagous to Esc E)
	^X ^?	delete backard one sentence (analagous to Esc A)

Try all of these (please be careful).  If you delete "too much," you
can restore this file by giving the command:

	^X ^R ^M (or Enter)

then answering "Y" to the question.

Those are the most often used commands.  At this point, the tutorial
is over and you should go back to the "freyja.doc" file.  This file
explains the rest of the concepts in Freyja.

We will finish by explaining one last useful command:

	^X ^C

This command exits from Freyja.
