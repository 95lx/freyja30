	   Installation Instructions for HP100LX ("Cougar")
			    MS/DOS Version

Code Letter: D

Features:

The  version can do anything that the IBM PC version can do.  In
addition:

	- It supports three screen ZOOM modes.
	- It uses the HP100LX character set.
	- The screen handling is set for the HP100's modes
	- The MENU and blue Fn keys work.
	- The cursor is set to a block cursor.
	- Many resource file settings are adjusted for the 100LX.

Note that the program can run from under the FILER or without the
system manager at all (a "bare" 100LX).


------------------------------------------------------------
ZOOM Modes

Freyja supports three zoom modes.  The ^X + command (and ZOOM key) 
changes the font among these choices:

	argument	rows x columns

	2		25 x 80
	80		18 x 64
	84		16 x 40

With no argument, the command cycles to the next one.  With an
argument, the command selects that font.


------------------------------------------------------------
Printing:

Freyja prints to the PRN device (as configured into the .res file: see
the PRINTER* tables).  The program does _not_ perform flow control in
any fashion, nor does it initialize the port in any way.  That said, I
believe that MS/DOS _does_ do XON/XOFF flow control with the PRN
device.

Printing on the HP100LX can therefore be somewhat tricky: you should
use your favorite method to configure and power on the serial port. 


------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

1) Obtain an IBM PC version (see inibmpc.doc).  Note that all *.EXE
files are included with the distribution, so that you don't have to
compile anything if you just want to run the off-the-shelf versions.

2) Copy the freyja.exe file to somewhere useful in the HP100LX.  You
can copy all .exe files if you like, but the others were _not_
compiled with an eye on keeping them small.  You may also choose to
not copy all of the documentation.

3) If you want to run a standard resource file, do:

	copy indos100.ri <someplace in your search path on the HP100LX>\freyja.ri

(I put this file in the C:\_DAT directory.)

4) You probably want to install the program in the application
manager.  If so, follow the standard directions in Chapter 5 of the
100LX manual.  Also:

	- The file freyja.icn in the distribution is an icon for Freyja.

	- If you start the comment line with an upside down ? mark (Fn
	+ 3), it won't ask for an extra key press when exiting.

5) If you want to make any changes in the resource file, then you will
want to review these files:

	*.res
	resource.doc
	thorres.doc

The mechanics of the change are:

	<edit *.res and make the changes>
	thorres -c 850 -l en -f d freyja.res -h frres.h
	copy freyja.ri <someplace in your search path>

Notes:

	- replace the "en" with "dk" if you are using Danish messages
	- replace the "850" with "437" if you are using code page 437
	- replace the "850" with "852" if you are using code page 852
	- replace the "850" with "865" if you are using code page 865

6) The minimum system RAM required is 185K.  This number assumes a 40K
swap area, and no other applications open or other uses of memory, but
running from the Application Manager with:

	|185

after the path name.

7) Instead of setting the swap area size in freyja.res, you could run
a DOS shell (MENU OPTIONS DOS) in the FILER or your other favorite
method and give this command line:

	freyja -z 40

But this is more work as you have to do it each time.

8) A typical configuration is to put freyja.exe in C:\ and freyja.res
in C:\_DAT.  To make this work, do:

create or add to config.sys:

	shell=command /p

create or add to autoexec.bat:

	set FREYJADIR=C:\_DAT
	SYSMGR

Then reboot.
