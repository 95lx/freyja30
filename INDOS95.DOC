	   Installation Instructions for HP95LX ("Jaguar")
			    MS/DOS Version

Code Letter: J

Features:

The Jaguar version can do anything that the IBM PC version can do.  In
addition:

	- It supports the tiny font technoloyg.
	- It uses the HP95LX character set.
	- The screen handling is set for the HP95's modes
	- The MENU key works.
	- The cursor is set to a block cursor.
	- Many resource file settings are adjusted for the 95LX.

Note that the program can run from under the FILER or without the
system manager at all (a "bare" 95LX).


------------------------------------------------------------
Tiny Fonts:

Freyja supports Dave Goodman's Tiny Font technology.  The ^X + command
changes the font among these choices:

	arg.	display mode	rows x columns		character size

	24	normal text	16 x 40
	25	graphics	21 x 60			6 x 4
	26	graphics	25 x 80			5 x 3

With no argument, the command cycles to the next one.  With an
argument (under "arg."), the command selects that font.  All graphics
fonts use the same 6 x 4 character bitmap: the difference is in how
may pixels and scan lines are shown.

The font is defined in the .res file.

The program automatically switches to font 0 when changing
applications and invoking the file getter.  Thus, while the font
selections are available on menus, you probably will wind up using the
^X + command.

Yes, all the font manipulation is written in C.

If you want to bring Freyja up in font 25 or 26, do _not_ set the
SCRNTYPE paramter.  It doesn't work.  Instead, use INIT macro with
one of these sequences:

	^U25^X+y
	^U26^X+y


------------------------------------------------------------
Printing:

Freyja prints to the PRN device (as configured into the .res file: see
the PRINTER* tables).  The program does _not_ perform flow control in
any fashion, nor does it initialize the port in any way.  That said, I
believe that MS/DOS _does_ do XON/XOFF flow control with the PRN
device.

Printing on the HP95LX can therefore be somewhat tricky: you should
use your favorite method to configure and power on the serial port. 


------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

1) Obtain an IBM PC version (see inibmpc.doc).  Note that all *.EXE
files are included with the distribution, so that you don't have to
compile anything if you just want to run the off-the-shelf versions.

2) Copy the freyja.exe file to somewhere useful in the HP95LX.  You
can copy all .exe files if you like, but the others were _not_
compiled with an eye on keeping them small.  You may also choose to
not copy all of the documentation.

3) If you want to run a standard resource file, do:

	copy indos95.ri <someplace in your search path on the HP95LX>\freyja.ri

(I put this file in the C:\_DAT directory.)

4) If you want to make any changes in the resource file, then you will
want to review these files:

	*.res
	resource.doc
	thorres.doc

The mechanics of the change are:

	<edit *.res and make the changes>
	thorres -c 850 -l en -f j freyja.res -h frres.h
	copy freyja.ri <someplace in your search path>


Notes:

	- replace the "en" with "dk" if you are using Danish messages
	- replace the "850" with "852" if you are using code page 852
	- replace the "850" with "865" if you are using code page 865

5) The minimum system RAM required is 282K.  This number assumes a 40K
swap area, and no other applications open or other uses of memory, but
running under the FILER.  Less memory would be required if running
"bare."

	>>>>> This number is for Version 2.1.  It was not re-checked
	for Version 2.2, but the new number should be very close
	to this one.

6) Instead of setting the swap area size in freyja.res, you could run
a DOS shell (MENU S in the FILER) and give this command line:

	freyja -z 40

But this is more work as you have to do it each time.

7) A typical configuration is to put freyja.exe in C:\ and freyja.res
in C:\_DAT.  To make this work, do:

create or add to config.sys:

	shell=command /p

create or add to autoexec.bat:

	set FREYJADIR=C:\_DAT
	$SYSMGR

Then reboot.
