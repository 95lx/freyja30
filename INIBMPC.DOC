		 Installation Instructions for IBM PC
			and Compatible Systems

Code Letter: I

Features:

The IBMPC version supports all standard features plus:

- function and Alt- key support
- direct screen output support
- 40-column display mode


Caution:

If you have a Hercules graphics card, it may fail the autodetection
algorithm.  You can force it to a regular monochome screen by setting
SCRNTYPE to 7 in freyja.res (and rebuilding the .ri file, of course).


------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

---------- from diskette --------------------

1) Create a directory on the MS/DOS system to hold the files.

2) Copy the files from the diskette(s) to this directory.

	copy a:*.*

3) Install it, for each file:

	freyja.exe
	makeexm.exe
	moon.exe
	thorabk.exe
	thorcont.exe
	thornumb.exe
	thorpage.exe
	thorpbk.exe
	thorres.exe
	thortext.exe

do:

	copy <file> <whereever you put your executables>

4) Install the documentation files, for each file:

	copying.doc	[help]
	fcalc.doc	[help]
	fcmdlist.doc	[help]
	fcmdxref.doc	[help]
	fmenus.doc	[help]
	freyja.doc	[help]
	fsf.doc		[help]
	ftutoria.doc	[help]
	league.doc	[help]
	makeexm.doc
	moon.doc
	thorabk.doc
	thorcont.doc
	thornumb.doc
	thorpage.doc
	thorpbk.doc
	thorres.doc
	thortext.doc
	warranty.doc	[help]

do:

	copy <file> <wherever you put your documentation>

Consult freyja.doc for search path information.  The files marked
[help] are only required for the help functions; the editor works fine
for all other purposes without them.  However, if you install them,
you should install them in your search path.

5) If you want to run a standard resource file, do:

	copy inibmpc.ri <someplace in your search path>\freyja.ri

Note that you are renaming the file as part of the copy.

6) If you want to make any changes in the resource file, then you will
want to review these files:

	*.res
	resource.doc
	thorres.doc

The mechanics of the change are:

	<edit *.res and make the changes>
	thorres -c 437 -l en -f i freyja.res -h frres.h
	copy freyja.ri <someplace in your search path>

Notes:

	- replace the "en" with "dk" if you are using Danish messages
	- replace the "437" with "850" if you are using code page 850
	- replace the "437" with "852" if you are using code page 852
	- replace the "437" with "865" if you are using code page 865


---------- from freyja.exe file --------------------

1) Be on an MS/DOS host or one that can run MS/DOS executables.

2) Create a directory to hold the files.

3) Do:

	cd [[the destination directory]]
	[[the name of the freyja2.exe file on your system]]

4) Follow the steps in the first installation starting with step 3.


---------- from freyja.tar file --------------------

1) Be on a Unix host or one with a tar command.

2) Create a directory to hold the files.

3) Do:

	cd [[that directory]]
	tar xvf [[the name of the freyja.tar file on your system]]

4) Transfer the files to an MS/DOS system.  Don't forget that files
with names of these forms:

	*.exe
	*.exm
	*.icn
	*.ri

must be transferred in "binary" mode.  Other files are text files and
follow the Unix convention of using single LF's for newlines.  Thus,
newlines must be converted to CR/LFs for MS/DOS use.  This conversion
can be made by reading in and writing out each file using the MS/DOS
version of Freyja, or by a Replace String command in the Unix version.

5) Follow the steps in the first installation starting with step 3.


---------- from freyja.tar.z file --------------------

1) Be on a Unix host or one with gunzip and tar commands.

2) Create a directory to hold the files.

3) Do:

	cd [[that directory]]
	gunzip < [[the name of the freyja.tar.Z file on your system]] |
		tar xvf - 

4) Transfer the files to an MS/DOS system.  Don't forget that files
with names of these forms:

	*.exe
	*.exm
	*.icn
	*.ri

must be transferred in "binary" mode.

5) Follow the steps in the first installation starting with step 3.


---------- changing the C code --------------------

You can make many changes by simply editing the resource file.  If you
want to change the C code, do:

1) In lib.h, make sure that the correct system constant is #defined.

2) Edit turboc.cfg to suit your system.

3) Make it:

	copy makefile.msd makefile
	[[edit makefile to select the regular, system-manager compliant,
		or no-calculator version]]
	make
