	   Installation Instructions for HP100LX ("Cougar")
		   System Manager Compliant Version

Code Letter: C

Features:

The sysmgr version can do anything that the IBM PC version can do. 
Mostly.  In addition:

	- It is fully system-manager compliant.
	- Application manager calls are used for keyboard input.
	- The calculator is not present (the Turbo C floating point libraries
	use and interrupt in their interface; such use conflicts with sytem
	manage compliance guidelines).
	- The execute system command function is present.  However, some
	MS/DOS commands may invisibly trash your system.  It will tend to
	work best if Freyja is the only application open.
	- The search path for FREYAJ.RI and the help files is forced to
	include C:\_DAT.
	- Several resource file settings allow you to make the program
	behave a lot like MEMO.
	- It uses the HP100LX character set.
	- The screen handling is set for the HP100's modes
	- The MENU key works.
	- The cursor is set to a block cursor.
	- Many resource file settings are adjusted for the 100LX.


------------------------------------------------------------
MEMO:

Freyja includes much of the functionality of the built-in MEMO
program. This means that if MEMO can do it, so can Freyja.  However,
the commands may be a little different.  In particular, you can make
the word-motion and Home/End key commands work like MEMO's by changing
these freyja.res file options to:

	WORDEND		"N"
	HOMEEND		"Y"

The menus and function keys are organized differently.  No, I'm not
going to try to list the differences.

Of course, Freyja can do many things that MEMO cannot.

Many people simply put Freyja on the MEMO key.

Freyja can read and write MEMO's "ASCII" files, but not MEMO's
"formatted" form.  When reading and writing MEMO's "ASCII" files, be
sure that Freyjs is in Wrap mode.


------------------------------------------------------------
ZOOM Modes

Freyja supports three zoom modes.  The ^X + command (and ZOOM key) 
changes the font among these choices:

	argument	rows x columns

	2		25 x 80
	80		18 x 64
	84		16 x 40

With no argument, the command cycles to the next one.  With an
argument, the command selects that font.


------------------------------------------------------------
Clipboard:

The program will copy, cut, and paste to and from the clipboard.  Note
that the program distinguishes between the clipboard and the kill
buffer: they are _not_ synonymous nor are any automatic conversions
between them performed.

Commands that use the kill buffer:

	^W	cut
	^[ W	copy
	^Y	paste
	all deletion commands
	Edit menu

Commands that use the clipboard:

	CUT key
	COPY key
	PASTE key
	Ctrl-F2	copy
	Ctrl-F3	cut
	Ctrl-F4	paste
	Clip menu

You may have to adjust the size of the clipboard in SETUP if you are
cutting and pasting large items.


------------------------------------------------------------
Printing:

Freyja prints to the PRN device (as configured into the .res file: see
the PRINTER* tables).  The program does _not_ perform flow control in
any fashion, nor does it initialize the port in any way.  That said, I
believe that MS/DOS _does_ do XON/XOFF flow control with the PRN
device.

Printing on the HP100LX can therefore be somewhat tricky: you should
use your favorite method to configure and power on the serial port. 


------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

1) Obtain an IBM PC version (see ibmpc.doc).  Note that all *.EXM and
*.RI files are included with the distribution, so that you don't have
to compile anything if you just want to run the off-the-shelf
versions.

You can run any of the .EXE files on the HP100LX.  They all run under
MS/DOS mode.  These instructions only discuss the .EXM files.

2) Copy the freyja.exm file and the memutil.exm file to somewhere
useful in the HP100LX, quite probably C:\_DAT.

You can install the documentation if you like.

3) If you want to run a standard resource file, do:

	copy insys100.ri c:\_dat\freyja.ri

If you want to make any changes in the resource file, then you will
want to review these files:

	*.res
	resource.doc
	thorres.doc

The mechanics of the change are:

	<edit *.res and make the changes>
	thorres -c 850 -l en -f c freyja.res -h frres.h
	copy freyja.ri c:\_dat\freyja.ri

Notes:

	- replace the "en" with "dk" if you are using Danish messages
	- replace the "850" with "437" if you are using code page 437
	- replace the "850" with "852" if you are using code page 852
	- replace the "850" with "865" if you are using code page 865

4) The minimum system RAM required is 352K.  This number assumes a 40K
swap area, and no other applications open or other uses of memory. 
Actual requirements are less, but this is the smallest size that you
can set system RAM to.

	>>>>> This number is for Version 2.1.  It was not re-checked
	for Version 2.2, but the new number should be very close
	to this one.

5) You probably want to install the program in the application
manager.  If so, follow the standard directions in Chapter 5 of the
100LX manual.  Also:

	- The file freyja.icn in the distribution is an icon for Freyja.

	- The file memutil.icn in the distribution is an icon for MemUtil.

You can put these programs (or any others) on any hot key you like. 
However, the application manager will only let you use a few.  To use
other keys:

	- ensure that there is no entry defined in the application manager
	- create an apname.lst file with the right path, key, and name
	  (see item 5 in insys95.doc)
	- start the application manager

The entry will be initialized correctly.  Select and edit it to set
the icon.  Leave the apname.lst file around in case the application
manager gets any funny ideas...

6) The program can't display error messages until it gets going.  If
it can't get started, it might be for one of these reasons:

	- it cannot find or read the resource file (freyja.ri not in
	C:\_DAT or in the search path)

	- it cannot allocate the swap area (too large or Lotus 1-2-3 running)

	- it cannot initialize the terminal (broken or wrong freyja.ri file)

7) If you want to recompile the program, you will need to edit the
initial symbol definition blocks in the makefile (this sounds more
complicated than it is).  Comment out the ones for the IBM PC version
and remove the comments from the ones for the system manager version. 
Then do:

	erase f*.obj
	erase smjaguar.obj

and recompile everything.  Reverse this process -- including the erase
f*.obj -- when switching back to the IBM PC version.
