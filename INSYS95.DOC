	   Installation Instructions for HP95LX ("Jaguar")
		   System Manager Compliant Version

Code Letter: S

Features:

The sysmgr version can do anything that the IBM PC version can do. 
Mostly.  In addition:

	- It works with 95buddy.
	- It is fully system-manager compliant.
	- Application manager calls are used for keyboard input.
	- It uses the built-in file getter.
	- You can set the default file pattern to use.
	- The calculator is not present (the Turbo C floating point libraries
	use and interrupt in their interface; such use conflicts with sytem
	manage compliance guidelines).
	- The execute system command function is present.  However, some
	MS/DOS commands may invisibly trash your system.
	- The search path for FREYAJ.RI and the help files is forced to
	include C:\_DAT.
	- Several resource file settings allow you to make the program
	behave a lot like MEMO.
	- It supports the tiny font technology.
	- It uses the HP95LX character set.
	- The screen handling is set for the HP95's modes
	- The MENU key works.
	- The cursor is set to a block cursor.
	- Many resource file settings are adjusted for the 95LX.


------------------------------------------------------------
MEMO:

Freyja includes all functionality of the built-in MEMO program. This
means that if MEMO can do it, so can Freyja.  However, the commands
may be a little different.  In particular:

- The base MEMO function keys are Ctrl- function keys in Freyja.
- You can make the word-motion and Home/End key commands work like
  MEMO's by changing these freyja.res file options to:

	WORDEND		"N"
	HOMEEND		"Y"

- The menus are organized differently.  No, I'm not going to try to
list the differences.

Of course, Freyja can do many things that MEMO cannot.

Many people simply put Freyja on the MEMO key.  In fact, 95BUDDY has
special support for doing just this.

Freyja can read and write MEMO's  file.  When doing this, be sure that
Freyjs is in Wrap mode.


------------------------------------------------------------
Tiny Fonts:

Freyja supports Dave Goodman's Tiny Font technology.  The ^X + command
changes the font among these choices:

	arg.	display mode	rows x columns		character size

	24	normal text	16 x 40
	25	graphics	21 x 60			6 x 4
	26	graphics	25 x 80			5 x 3

With no argument, the command cycles to the next one.  With an
argument (under "arg."), the command selects that font.  All graphics
fonts use the same 6 x 4 character bitmap: the difference is in how
may pixels and scan lines are shown.

The font is defined in the .res file.

The program automatically switches to font 0 when changing
applications and invoking the file getter.  Thus, while the font
selections are available on menus, you probably will wind up using the
^X + command.

Yes, all the font manipulation is written in C.

If you want to bring Freyja up in font 25 or 26, do _not_ set the
SCRNTYPE paramter.  It doesn't work.  Instead, use INIT macro with
one of these sequences:

	^U25^X+y
	^U26^X+y


------------------------------------------------------------
Clipboard:

The program will copy, cut, and paste to and from the clipboard.  Note
that the program distinguishes between the clipboard and the kill
buffer: they are _not_ synonymous nor are any automatic conversions
between them performed.

Commands that use the kill buffer:

	^W	cut
	^[ W	copy
	^Y	paste
	all deletion commands
	Edit menu

Commands that use the clipboard:

	Ctrl-F2	copy
	Ctrl-F3	cut
	Ctrl-F4	paste
	Clip menu


------------------------------------------------------------
Printing:

Freyja prints to the PRN device (as configured into the .res file: see
the PRINTER* tables).  The program does _not_ perform flow control in
any fashion, nor does it initialize the port in any way.  That said, I
believe that MS/DOS _does_ do XON/XOFF flow control with the PRN
device.

Printing on the HP95LX can therefore be somewhat tricky: you should
use your favorite method to configure and power on the serial port. 


------------------------------------------------------------
95BUDDY:

Freyja works well with 95BUDDY version 3.1.  This operation is due to
the effort of Jeffrey Mattox (95BUDDY's author) and myself.

No special 95BUDDY configuration is required.  However, if you leave
the default cursor, it looks silly.  Try cursor=0.


------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

1) Obtain an IBM PC version (see ibmpc.doc).  Note that all *.EXM
files are included with the distribution, so that you don't have to
compile anything if you just want to run the off-the-shelf versions.

You can run any of the .EXE files on the HP95LX.  They all run under
MS/DOS mode.  These instructions only discuss the .EXM files.

2) Copy the freyja.exm file and the memutil.exm file to somewhere
useful in the HP95LX, quite probably C:\_DAT.

You can install the documentation if you like.

3) If you want to run a standard resource file, do:

	copy insys95.ri c:\_dat\freyja.ri

If you want to make any changes in the resource file, then you will
want to review these files:

	*.res
	resource.doc
	thorres.doc

The mechanics of the change are:

	<edit *.res and make the changes>
	thorres -c 850 -l en -f s freyja.res -h frres.h
	copy freyja.ri c:\_dat

Notes:

	- replace the "en" with "dk" if you are using Danish messages
	- replace the "850" with "852" if you are using code page 852
	- replace the "850" with "865" if you are using code page 865

4) The minimum system RAM required is 250K.  This number assumes a 40K
swap area, and no other applications open or other uses of memory.

	>>>>> This number is for Version 2.1.  It was not re-checked
	for Version 2.2, but the new number should be very close
	to this one.

5) Create or add to your C:\_DAT\APNAME.LST file.  Here is an example
entry that uses the Alt-MEMO key:

	C:\_DAT\FREYJA.EXM,bb00,Freyja^M

Or, if you are like me:

	C:\_DAT\FREYJA.EXM,b800,Freyja^M

And thus override the built-in MEMO function.  Here is my entry for
MemUtil (you probably only want to install one of these):

	C:\_DAT\MEMUTIL.EXM,3200,MemUtil^M

This scan code designates Alt-M.

The first field if the full pathname of the .EXM file.  It must be in
upper case, and the drive letter (e.g. "C:") must be the same drive as
the APNAME.LST file.  The second field is the scan code of the hot
key.  The third field is the name.  The whole thing is terminated by a
Carriage Return.

	key		base	w/Ctrl	w/Alt

	FILER		a800	ae00	ab00
	COMM		ac00	b200	af00
	APPT		b000	b600	b300
	PHONE		b400	ba00	b700
	MEMO		b800	be00	bb00
	123		bc00	c200	bf00
	CALC		c000	c600	c300

Don't forget to reboot the HP95LX.


6) The program can't display error messages until it gets going.  If
it can't get started, it might be for one of these reasons:

	- it cannot find or read the resource file (freyja.ri not in
	C:\_DAT or in the search path)

	- it cannot allocate the swap area (too large or Lotus 1-2-3 running)

	- it cannot initialize the terminal (broken or wrong freyja.ri file)

7) If you want to recompile the program, you will need to edit the
initial symbol definition blocks in the makefile (this sounds more
complicated than it is).  Comment out the ones for the IBM PC version
and remove the comments from the ones for the system manager version. 
Then do:

	erase f*.obj
	erase smjaguar.obj

and recompile everything.  Reverse this process -- including the erase
f*.obj -- when switching back to the IBM PC version.
