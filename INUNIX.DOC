	      Installation Instructions for Unix Systems

Code Letter: U

Features:

The Unix version supports all standard features plus:

- termcap
- interpret VT100 function keys


---------- from freyja.tar file --------------------

1) Be on a Unix host or one with a tar command.
2) Create a directory to hold the files.
3) Do:

	cd [[that directory]]
	tar xvf [[the name of the freyja.tar file on your system]]

4) In lib.h, make sure that the correct system constant is #defined.
5) Make it:

	mv makefile.unx Makefile
	make

or:

	ln -s makefile.unx Makefile
	make

6) Install it, for each file:

	freyja
	makeexm
	moon
	thorabk
	thorcont
	thornumb
	thorpage
	thorpbk
	thorres
	thortext

do:

	cp <file> <your binary directory, /usr/local/bin?>

7) Install the documentation, for each file:

	copying.doc	[help]
	fcalc.doc	[help]
	fcmdlist.doc	[help]
	fcmdxref.doc	[help]
	fmenus.doc	[help]
	freyja.doc	[help]
	fsf.doc		[help]
	ftutoria.doc	[help]
	league.doc	[help]
	makeexm.doc
	moon.doc
	thorabk.doc
	thorcont.doc
	thornumb.doc
	thorpage.doc
	thorpbk.doc
	thorres.doc
	thortext.doc
	warranty.doc	[help]

do:

	# cp <file> <your local documentation directory>

Consult freyja.doc for search path information.  The files marked
[help] are only required for the help functions; the editor works fine
for all other purposes without them.  However, if you install them,
you should install them in your search path.

8) If you want to run a standard resource file, do:

	copy freyja.ri <someplace in your search path>

9) If you want to make any changes in the resource file, then you will
want to review these files:

	*.res
	resource.doc
	thorres.doc

The mechanics of the change are:

	<edit *.res and make the changes that you like>
	make freyja.ri
	copy freyja.ri <someplace in your search path>


---------- from freyja.tar.z file --------------------

1) Be on a Unix host or one with gunzip and tar commands.
2) Create a directory to hold the files.
3) Do:

	cd [[that directory]]
	gunzip < [[the name of the freyja.tar.z file on your system]] |
		tar xvf - 

4) Follow the steps in the first installation, starting with step 4.


---------- from diskette --------------------

1) Create a directory to hold the files.

2) Copy the freyja files from the diskette(s) to this directory.  How
you do this varies from system to system.  Don't forget that files
with names of these forms:

	*.exe
	*.exm
	*.icn
	*.ri

Other files are text files and follow the MS/DOS convention of using
CR/LF's for newlines.  Thus, newlines must be converted to single LFs
for Unix use.  This conversion can be made by reading in the file and
writing it out using ^U ^X ^W (or ^U ^X ^S) using the MS/DOS version
of Freyja.

3) Follow the steps in the first installation, starting with step 4.
