USAGE:

memutil (from the HP95LX or HP100LX System Manager)

PURPOSE:

This program displays memory and status.

OPTIONS:

none

RESTRICTIONS:

none

DEFAULTS:

none

FUNCTION:

MemUtil is a program for displaying and snapshoting memory in the
HP95LX or HP100LX when the system manager is in operation.  When you
first start it, you see which applications are available, their hot
keys, and their status.  As such, it is a handy guide to your system. 
However, the program can do much more.  It can:

- Show you detailed information about each application.
- Show you the application's data segment.
- Show you the MS/DOS memory chains.
- Show you the contents of any of the MS/DOS chain blocks.
- Show you arbitrary memory locations.
- Show you the character set and function keys.

In addition, any of these displays can be saved to either the
clipboard or to a file.  Most of the displays can be saved as either
human-readable text or in binary form.

The built-in help text serves as the manual.

I would like to credit the authors of "The Wait Group's MS-DOS
Developer's Guide, Second Edition" for explaining the techniques for
retrieving the MS/DOS memory chains.

I would like to credit Hewlett-Packard company, and in particular
Everett Kaser, for explaining the techniques for retrieving the
application control blocks (in the "what" program).

ABOUT THE ICON:

The icon shows a magnifying glass, a reasonably traditional symbol for
"looking into things."  The (hexadecimal) digits are the ASCII values
for "fin", my usual monikor.
