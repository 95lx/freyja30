USAGE:

moon [options] [<year> [<mon> [<day> [<hour> [<min> [<sec>]]]]]]

PURPOSE:

Prints a current representation of the phase of the moon, in either
text or "pictorial" format.

OPTIONS:

Option names always start with a single dash ("-") and must be spelled
exactly as shown but may be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case.
No embedded spaces may be used in the option name.  Note that many
options also have a "short" form.  If an option has a parameter, the
parameter must be separated from the option name with one or more
space or tab characters.  Option names or option name/parameter pairs
may appear anywhere in the command line after the command name.

	-bright
	-b
	Tells the program to assume that the screen has bright
	characters on a dark background.  If omitted, the program
	assumes that the screen has dark charcters on a bright
	background.  It only applies to the -phase option.

	-c <#>
	Sets the number of columns (screen width) used by the "phase"
	picture to #.  Maximum / default # is 79.

	-date
	-d
	Prints the current date as used in ISO notation and is of the
	form:

1990-09-20 10:31:59

	-fill
	-f
	Tells the program to fill in the background.  It only applies
	to the -phaseR option.

	-jaguar
	-j
	Sets the number of columns and rows used by the "phase"
	picture to 39 and 10, which is the right size for an HP95LX
	Jaguar.

	-long
	-l
	-timestamp
	-t
	Prints the long timestamp.  The long stamp is the "official
	phase of the moon" timestamp and is of the form:

10:31:59am Thursday, 20 September 1990: New Moon+0d 6h 2m 59s

	-moon
	-m
	Prints the moon phase information.  It is of the form:

 6 hours, 4 minutes, 11 seconds since the New Moon

	-phase
	-p
	Prints the current phase as a picture.  It is of the form:

                              =                =
                         =                          =
                      =                                =
                   =                                      =
                  =                                        =
                =                                            =
               =                                              =
               =                                              =
               =                                              =
               =                                              =
               =                                              =
                =                                            =
                 =                                          =
                  =                                        =
                    =                                    =
                      =                                =
                          =                        =
                                =            =

	-r <#>
	Sets the number of rows used by the "phase" picture to #.
	Default is 18.

	-short
	-s
	Prints a short form of the phase of the moon.  It is of the
	form:

10:37:12am 8/20/90: NM+0d 6h 8m 12s

	-what
	-w
	Prints a description of the phase of the moon.  It is of the
	form:

 New Moon + 0d 6h 8m 37s: Waxing Crescent, DARK:BRIGHT

	-zone <#>
	-z <#>
	Sets the local time zone difference from GMT.  It defaults to
	6 (Central Standard Time).  Changing this is nice, but not
	crucial as the algorithm has a noticable "jitter" with respect
	to the actual phase.

RESTRICTIONS:

The program is Northern Hemisphere-centric: the moon picture and phase
descriptions are flipped if you are in the Southern Hemisphere.

The program assumes as 24 x 80 display: it should go look.

Times before the base time in 1975 or after the end of 1999 won't work.

DEFAULTS:

If none of the -d, -l, -m, -p, -s, or -w options are given, -m and -p are
assumed.

The current time is assumed.

FUNCTION:

This program prints the phase of the moon in any of a variety of
formats and for any of a variety of times.

By default, it uses the current time.  However, you may specify an
alternate date or hour by adding parameters.  For example:

	moon 1988		uses 00:00:00 on Jan 1 of 1988

	moon 1988 3 5		uses 00:00:00 on Mar 5 of 1988

	moon 1988 3 5 14 33 12	uses 14:33:12 on Mar 5 of 1988

This program was originally written in PL/1 at the M.I.T. Architecture
Machine Group.  IT was translated to Fortran, then to C by Brian Hess.
It was rewritten several times by Craig Finseth.

The algorithm is a first-order approximation to the correct phase of
the moon calculation (one that has upwards of 30 sin terms).  The base
time is 10:21am 1/12/75 (GMT) and times before that do not work.  A
lunar cycle is assumed to be 42,532 minutes long.  This algorithm is
known to be incorrect.  It, however, is retained in honor of the
spirit of the original implementation (the approximation is the only
thing left: even the time constants have been refined).
