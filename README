-----------------------------------------------------------------
What It Is

Freyja2 combines the old Freyja and MemUtil releases into a single
release.

Freyja is an Emacs-type text editor that implements my choice of Emacs
commands.  It also includes an RPN-calculator and perpetual calendar. 
It is extensible by changing the source code and recompiling.  While it
runs on UNIX systems, it is targeted to MS/DOS laptop and palmtop
machines.

As a text editor, Freyja includes the following features:

	- full range of character, line, word, sentence, and
	paragraph-oriented commands.
	- search, replace, and query replace
	- deletions are automatically saved into a "kill buffer"
	- ability to edit up to 11 files at once
	- ability to view two indepenant windows at once
	- integrated help facility
	- integrated menu facility
	- commands to change the case of text, change indentation,
	and perform many other functions
	- can record and play back keyboard macros
	- includes a perpetual calendar
	- includes a fully-integrated HP-45A type calculator
	- configurable with a resource file
	- system-manager compliant version for the HP95LX
	- the HP95LX version supports tiny fonts that can display up to
	  25 x 80 characters on the 95's screen

The resource file contains all messages, the command tables, the
menus, and many configuration parameters.  You can thus alter the
program's behavior in many ways _without_ having to know or compile C
code.

MemUtil is a program for displaying and snapshoting memory in the
HP95LX when the system manager is in operation.  When you first start
it, you see which applications are available, their hot keys, and
their status.  As such, it is a handy guide to your system.  However,
the program can do much more.  It can show you:

	- detailed information about each application
	- the application's data segment
	- the MS/DOS memory chains
	- the contents of any of the MS/DOS chain blocks
	- arbitrary memory locations
	- the character set and function keys

In addition, any of these displays can be saved to either the
clipboard or to a file.  Most of the displays can be saved as either
human-readable text or in binary form.

The built-in help text serves as the manual.

Also included are a variety of utility programs:

	makeexm converts .exe files to system-manager format .exm
	moon shows the phase of the moon
	thorabk converts HP95LX appointment book files to ASCII text
	thorpbk converts HP95LX phone book files to and from ASCII text
	thorres compiles the resource file

and several other commands.

International users will find that Freyja supports you in many ways. 
You will notice that Freyja is release with support for both English
and Danish (dansk) languages.  The latter is found in the rlangdk.res
file and has all messages and prompts translated to that language. 
International support is described fully in the freyja.doc file (near
the end).

Credits:

MemUtil:

I would like to credit the authors of "The Wait Group's MS-DOS
Developer's Guide, Second Edition" for explaining the techniques for
retrieving the MS/DOS memory chains.

I would like to credit Hewlett-Packard company, and in particular
Everett Kaser, for explaining the techniques for retrieving the
application control blocks (in the "what" program).

Freyja2:

I would like to thank Arne Christensen (arc@pine.dk) for providing the
Danish translations.

The idea for using the resource file was contributed by Graeme Cawsey
of Tuscan Consultants Ltd, Leeds, UK.  Alas, even though he let me
badger his code from him, I wound up writing it from scratch.

I would like to thank Dave Goodman for doing the first "tiny font"
implementation on the HP95LX.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Status:

With the exception of three files, the entire release is freeware
distributed under the same terms as GNU CopyLeft.

The files are c0s.asm, makeexm.c, and makeexm.exe.  These files are
placed wholly in the public domain and anyone, anywhere can use them
for any purpose in any way.  It is silly to make others have to
reinvent this particular wheel.  Please use them with my blessings.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Cost:

Freyja is provided free to anyone (see the later "How to Obtain a
Copy" section).  However, I would _deeply_ appreciate hearing (at all)
from you: please send a postcard and, if you like, suggest new
features!  I would also like to know how you learned abou Freyja and
how you obtained a copy....

How To Obtain a Copy:

Diskette: Send the author blank diskettes:

	- one, 3 1/2" (1.44 MB), or
	- two, 3 1/2" (720 KB), or

and a SASE or enough stamps to cover return postage plus a dollar or
so (so that I can buy a diskette mailer).  Or you can just send me
about US$5.00 in check, stamp, whatever and I will furnish the
diskette(s) and mailer.  Non-US people can send me four 1.44 MB 3 1/2"
diskettes in lieu of money.  (More money is always nice, but please
don't feel obligated in any way.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Supported Environments:

	Tested on SunOs 4.0.3.
	Should run under most Berkeley Unix environments.

	Tested on MS/DOS V3.x and should run on any MS/DOS version 2.0
	or later system.  Requires Borland Turbo C Version 2.0 or
	later to compile (it should compile and run under Microsoft C
	with only minor changes).

	Tested on HP95LX and HP100LX.

Memory chain routines (thormem and MemUtil's "Chains" item) use DOS
function 52H in interrupt 21H.  This is an undocumented call.

MemUtil uses an undocumented system manager call to locate the
application task table on the 95LX.
