# Basic entry format:

#	glyph <###> <code>
#	<line 0>
#	<line 1>
#	<line 2>
#	<line 3>
#	<line 4>
#	<line 5>
#
# <###> is the number of the character glyph.  Range 0 to 255.
#
# <code> is "" if no expanded form is supported, or a unique 2-character
# string.  When the form ^!XX is encountered in a string and XX matches
# this 2-character string, the <###> is substitued.  Otherwise, XX is
# output.
#
# <line 0> to <line 5> is exactly six strings.  They specify the bitmap.
# Each string must be exactly 4 characters long.  Non-space characters
# are set bits and space (32 decimal) characters represent reset bits.

# This item defines the attributes of each character.  Each value is a
# bit mask with the following assignments:
#
#	bit 2^0		lower case letter
#	bit 2^1		upper case letter
#	bit 2^2		same case letter (only one case available),
#			also covers other characters included in
#			tokens (e.g., digits and _ if you like)
#	bit 2^3		calculator number (digit, A-F, -#.,)
#	bit 2^4		whitespace character (space, tab)
#	bit 2^5		newline character
#	bit 2^6		sentence end character (.?!:)
#	bit 2^7		closing punctuation char ()]}"')

# Sentence end characters are what can end a sentence.  Closing
# punctuation characters are what can appear between the end of a
# sentence and the whitespace.

# You can't configure the paragraph break characters.  Sorry, ran out of bits.
