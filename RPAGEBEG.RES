#	glyph <###> <code>
#	<line 0>
#	<line 1>
#	<line 2>
#	<line 3>
#	<line 4>
#	<line 5>
#
# <###> is the number of the character glyph.  Range 0 to 255.
#
# <code> is "" if no expanded form is supported, or a unique 2-character
# string.  When the form ^!XX is encountered in a string and XX matches
# this 2-character string, the <###> is substitued.  Otherwise, XX is
# output.
#
# <line 0> to <line 5> is exactly six strings.  They specify the bitmap.
# Each string must be exactly 4 characters long.  Non-space characters
# are set bits and space (32 decimal) characters represent reset bits.
