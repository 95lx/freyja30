USAGE:

thorabk [options] <from-file> <to-file>

PURPOSE:

This command converts HP95LX Appointment Book files to ASCII files.

OPTIONS:

Option names always start with a single dash ("-") and must be spelled
exactly as shown but may be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case.
No embedded spaces may be used in the option name.  Note that many
options also have a "short" form.  If an option has a parameter, the
parameter must be separated from the option name with one or more
space or tab characters.  Option names or option name/parameter pairs
may appear anywhere in the command line after the command name.

	-verbose
	-v
	Shows the records as they are being processed.

RESTRICTIONS:

This program only converts one direction.  However, the output format
is such that you should be able to convert them back.

DEFAULTS:

A from or to file named "-" designates standard input or output.

FUNCTION:

The format is obvious, I hope.  Dates are in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
