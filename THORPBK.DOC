USAGE:

thorpbk [options] <from-file> <to-file>

PURPOSE:

This command converts HP95LX Phone Book files to and from ASCII files.

OPTIONS:

Option names always start with a single dash ("-") and must be spelled
exactly as shown but may be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case.
No embedded spaces may be used in the option name.  Note that many
options also have a "short" form.  If an option has a parameter, the
parameter must be separated from the option name with one or more
space or tab characters.  Option names or option name/parameter pairs
may appear anywhere in the command line after the command name.

	-frompbk
	-from
	-f
	Force the conversion to be from .PBK to ASCII.

	-topbk
	-to
	-t
	Force the conversion to be from ASCII to .PBK.

	-commentchar <char>
	-cc <char>
	Specifies the character that indicates that an input line is a
	comment and hence not to be converted.  It only applies when
	converting from ASCII to .PBK.  The character can be specified
	by decimal value or by typing the character.  For example:

		-cc 48		the only way to specify a '0'

		-cc ;
		-cc 59		same as previous

	-fieldsep <char>
	-fs <char>
	Specifies the character that separates fields.  If no field
	separator is supplied, fields are assumed to be separated by
	newlines.  The character can be specified by decimal value or
	by typing the character.

	-lines <#>
	-l <#>
	Specifies that entries are to be padded to <#> lines long. 
	Only applies when converting FROM and with no field separator
	specified.

	-debug
	-d
	Show additional debugging information.

	-verbose
	-v
	Shows the records as they are being processed.

RESTRICTIONS:

There are many implied restrictions when converting from ASCII to a
phone book due to the limitations of the phone book file format.

DEFAULTS:

-commentchar #

If neither -frompbk nor -topbk are supplied, the program attempts to
determine the direction of conversion by examining the file names.  In
this case, exactly one of the names must end in the .pbk extension.

A from or to file named "-" designates standard input or output.

FUNCTION:

This command operates in one of two ways.

First, it can convert an ASCII file to a phone book file.  In this
mode, the ASCII file can be in either of two formats.

This first format has one field per line:

	Aone
	Atwo
	Athree
		...

	Bone
	Btwo
	Bthree
		...

The first three or so fields will make the first phone book entry
("A"), the next will make the second entry ("B"), etc.  One or more
blank lines separates phone book entries: use Space characters for
embedded blank lines.

The second format has all fields on one line:

	Aone;Atwo;Athree;...
	Bone;Btwo;Bthree;...

The field separator character is used to delimit the fields.  You
specify which format to use by omitting a field separator (implies one
field per line) or specifying a field separator.

In both cases, records are converted in the same order that they
appear in the file.  The first field becomes the name, the second the
phone number, and the remaining field(s) become the address.  In
addition, lines starting with the comment character and completely
blank lines are not converted.

Second, it can convert a phone book file to an ASCII file.  Again, the
field separator is used to determine the file format.
